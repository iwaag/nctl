# nctl

Unified CLI for [pj-clusterintent](https://github.com/iwaag/pj-clusterintent): computes desired/actual
drift and runs standard workflows. Implementation plan: `devdocs/vision/core_reconcile/` in the parent repo.

## Layout

- `src/nctl_core/` — the library. All business logic lives here and returns pydantic models.
- `src/nctl_core/cli/` — thin Typer wrappers. Commands parse args, call the library, render.

## Setup

```bash
uv sync
cp example.nctl.toml ../nctl.toml   # at the pj-clusterintent root, git-ignored
export NAUTOBOT_TOKEN=...           # or set nautobot.token_file
```

## Usage

```bash
uv run nctl status
uv run nctl status --json
uv run nctl render dnsmasq
uv run nctl apply dnsmasq
uv run nctl apply dnsmasq --yes
```

`status` checks Nautobot connectivity/auth/intent-catalog presence, nodeutils dump freshness, and
parent-repo submodule state. Each of the three checks degrades independently: e.g. an unreachable
Nautobot still yields dump and submodule info, with `ok: false` and an entry in `errors`.

`render dnsmasq` fetches desired endpoints, IP ranges, and intent evaluations through GraphQL and
prints a deterministic dnsmasq configuration. Use `--out PATH` to write the configuration or
`--json` to inspect the complete render payload.

`apply dnsmasq` renders into an operation-specific artifact and invokes the deploy-only Ansible
playbook in `--check --diff` mode by default. Review that output, then use `--yes` for the real
apply. The configured inventory must resolve at least one host in `dnsmasq_server`; an existing
inventory file with an empty or missing group is rejected instead of succeeding as a no-op.

## Ansible configuration

```toml
[ansible]
playbook_dir = "ansible_agdev"
inventory = "inventories/generated/production.yml"
```

`playbook_dir` is the `ansible_agdev` checkout, resolved relative to `nctl.toml` when not absolute.
A relative `inventory` path resolves inside that checkout; an absolute inventory file or directory
is also accepted. Both `ansible-inventory` and `ansible-playbook` must be on `PATH`.
The bootstrap `hosts_intent.yml` does not contain service groups and therefore cannot select
`dnsmasq_server`; use the current production inventory until its composition moves into nctl.

Each apply stores its rendered conf at
`<events.log_dir>/<operation_id>/artifacts/dnsmasq-records.conf` and its JSON Lines event log at
`<events.log_dir>/<operation_id>.jsonl`.

## Conventions

- **Config**: `nctl.toml`, resolved as `--config` → `$NCTL_CONFIG` → `./nctl.toml` → parent-repo root.
  Tokens are never stored in the file (rejected by validation); use `token_env` / `token_file`.
- **JSON output**: every command returns a stable `nctl.<command>.v1` envelope via `--json`
  (spec: `docs/output-format.md`).
- **Event logs**: long-running operations emit JSON Lines with an operation ID
  (spec: `docs/event-log.md`).
- **Exit codes**: 0 ok / 1 command failure / 2 usage or config error.
- **Reads vs writes**: reads go through Nautobot GraphQL (`NautobotClient.graphql()`, a single
  unified client for both core DCIM/IPAM and `nintent`'s desired-state types); writes stay REST
  (Nautobot GraphQL is read-only by design, and the intent-catalog ViewSets remain the write path).

## Development

```bash
uv run pytest
```
